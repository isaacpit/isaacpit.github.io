# bootstrap-portfolio
Bootstrapped portfolio website using React. 

* Deprecating this repo to instead directly use ```isaacpit/portfolio``` and ```isaacpit/bandpage``` repos to host `github pages` projects with custom domain names pointing to those roots. I may use this repo again some time if I ever need to host something on `isaacpit.github.io/`
